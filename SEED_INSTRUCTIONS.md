# Seed Applicants Instructions

This guide explains how to add 20 dummy applicants to a job posting in the database.

## Prerequisites

- Backend server environment variables configured (`.env` file with `MONGODB_URI`)
- At least one job posting created in the database

## Method 1: Seed to First Job (Automatic)

This will automatically add 20 applicants to the first job posting found in the database:

```bash
cd hrms-backend
npm run seed:applicants
```

## Method 2: Seed to Specific Job (Recommended)

This allows you to specify which job posting to add applicants to:

1. **Get the Job ID:**
   - Go to Job Desk in the frontend
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Click on a job card
   - Look at the Network tab or Console to find the job `_id`
   - Or check MongoDB directly

2. **Run the seed script with Job ID:**

```bash
cd hrms-backend
npm run seed:job YOUR_JOB_ID_HERE
```

**Example:**
```bash
npm run seed:job 671234567890abcdef123456
```

## What Gets Created

The script creates 20 diverse applicants with:

- **Personal Info:** Name, email, phone, location
- **Experience:** 0-8 years (mix of freshers and experienced)
- **Current Employment:** Company, designation, CTC (for experienced candidates)
- **Skills:** Relevant technical skills (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
- **Education:** Degree details
- **Application Details:** 
  - Various stages (applied, screening, shortlisted, interview-scheduled, etc.)
  - Different sources (LinkedIn, Naukri, referral, etc.)
  - Resume URLs
  - Expected CTC and notice period

## Verification

After running the script:

1. Check the console output for confirmation
2. Go to Job Desk ‚Üí Click "View" on the job
3. You should see all 20 applicants listed
4. The job card should show the updated applications count

## Sample Output

```
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB
üìã Job Found: Software Engineer
üìç Department: 671234567890abcdef123456
‚úÖ Added 20 applicants
‚úÖ Updated job applications count to 20

üìä Summary:
   Job: Software Engineer
   Total Applicants: 20
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "No job postings found"**
- Create at least one job posting first from the Job Desk page

**Error: "Job with ID not found"**
- Verify the job ID is correct
- Check if the job exists in the database

**Error: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"**
- Verify `.env` file has correct `MONGODB_URI`
- Ensure MongoDB is running

## Notes

- Applicants have unique emails to avoid duplicates
- The script updates the job's `applications` count automatically
- You can run the script multiple times to add more applicants
- All applicants are marked as active by default
